Do Not Judge Strictly))
Because for me the important part here is project flow not he source code.

1) install mongodb
2) install redis
3) install nginx
4) Setup nginx config

open socket folder configure .env
first time use PORT 4001 then "npm start"
open new terminal change PORT 4002 then "npm start"

the same think for api but 3001 and 3002

if you will run only one server it will work because nginx will send all request to runned servers
